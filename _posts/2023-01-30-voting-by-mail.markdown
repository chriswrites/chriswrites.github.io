"Hey, are there any good new dinner spots in Gilbert, or at least coming soon?"

"Buck and Rider is coming. And Gadzooks, Cook and Craft, Call Her Martina…"

"No, I mean new new."

"New new?"

"Yeah, like something that doesn’t exist anywhere else."

"Uhh. How new are we talking?"

"Actually new. New new.’

"New?"

"Yes."

"Maybe if we get a drink at North, something will come to me."

“What are you going to get?”

“No part of me wants a burger right now, but I feel like I have to order the Big Butter Burger. It says it’s grilled in butter.”

“_In_ butter or _on_ butter?”

“_In_ butter.”

“Like, is it fried in the butter?”

“That’s what I’m hoping for.”

“I doubt they have a deep fryer filled with butter back there.”

“But what if there is.”

“That’d be incredible.”

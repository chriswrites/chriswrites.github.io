"What’s Dry January?"

"I think instead of making a resolution to drink less, you’re supposed to just not drink in January, then get hammered every month after."

"Cool cool. So what’s the article about?"

"Dry January cocktails."

"Oh, so juice?"

"No, cocktails."

"I don’t understand."

"I guess I don’t either."

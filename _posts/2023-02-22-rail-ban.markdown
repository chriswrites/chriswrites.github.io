Rail ban

[“I don’t want light rail"](https://www.gilbertsunnews.com/news/rail-ban-back-on-track-for-council-showdown/article_bbf2fb96-b2d1-11ed-896b-dfde1e4a2302.html)

"Chuck, I don't even want commuter rail."

"Jim, I'm right with you there. It'd bring nothing but crime, taxes, and homelessness."

"It would also get me to baseball games."

"Who asked you, citizen?!"

"I, uh, am who you're representing."

"Well you don't want rail. You really don't."

"I hear it could get me to downtown Tucson pretty quickly. How cool would that be?! Just sit on a train for a couple hours watching a movie, and BAM, Tucson."

"That sounds horrible."

"Yeah, Tucson is full of... poors."

"Poors? Really? Councilmemebers Torgeson and Buchli, you have to see how this could be amazing for the people of Gilbert."

"It'd be like Europe."

"Bunch of socialists that hate freedom."

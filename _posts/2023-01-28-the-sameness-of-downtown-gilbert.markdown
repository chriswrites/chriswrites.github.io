"Hey, I’m looking for a place to eat in downtown Gilbert."

"What kind of food are you after?"

"Well, I like burgers, anything containing fried chicken, vaguely healthy salads, and "American" style Mexican food." 

"…"

"Oh, and I really like WOW Wheat and Tower Station IPA."

"Great. You’ve just listed the menu at 90% of the restaurants. Go to Liberty Market… at least they can say they did it first."

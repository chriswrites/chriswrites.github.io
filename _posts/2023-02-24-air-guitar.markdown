"Dad, can we get sushi?"

"Sure."

"Dad, I want pizza."

"Uhh, those two things don't usually go together. One of you is going to be disappointed."

"But... it's 2023."

"That's a strong argument. Hmmm... Oh wait, what about Air Guitar?"

"The place we got gum last week?"

"Yeah, they have a sushi bar and a pizza stand."

"Is it good?"

"Look, this is the only place around that has both things you boys want. The food is probably going to be good enough."

"Can we also get fruit punch?"

"Ugh, sure. Just don't make me regret it."

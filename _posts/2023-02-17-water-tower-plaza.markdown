Meanwhile, at the [Jan 24th Gilbert Town Council Study Session](https://www.gilbertdocs.com/GilbertAgendaOnline/Meetings/ViewMeeting?id=980&doctype=2)…

"These renderings are fantastic."

"I’m wondering if there’s enough lighting around the picnic area."

"Good catch, Councilmember Koprowski. We’ll run metrics."

"Have we thought about artificial turf versus real grass?"

"We have, Councilmember Bongiovanni. Typically turf is hotter than asphalt, which would obviously be a problem over the summer. There are some high-performing turfs we could look into though. We’ll get on that."

"Looking at the parking situation, I’m a bit concerned that having two types of parking—parallel and diagonal—could be confusing."

"Confusing, Vice Mayor Tilque?’

"That’s what I said."

"Uh, ok. I guess we can look into that, too."

"I want some birds."

"What, Councilmember Anderson?"

"Birds. Little cute sculptures of them. We have the Riparian Preserve down the way, and it would tie the two areas together so nicely. Let’s add some lil fuzzies. Sprinkle em’ in.

"Lil fuzzies… sprinkled in…"

"Lil birdie poos."

"We’ll, uh, bounce that around the office. Thanks, uh, for everything you do here."

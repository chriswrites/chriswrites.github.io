"The [New Times Top 100](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/restaurants/the-2023-top-100-phoenix-restaurants-list-is-here-15476961) list came out this week."

"Yay, anything in Gilbert?"

"Caldwell County BBQ."

"Ooh that place is really good. Anything else?"

"Nope."

"Really?"

"Turns out young, creative chefs just aren’t moving to Gilbert in droves."

"I wonder why."

"Well, it’s not very affordable, we have no cultural institutions, no tourism to speak of, and our state representative is Andy Biggs, which means we’re packed with Andy Biggs voters."

"What’s wrong with Andy Biggs?"

"He’s, uh, not very popular with the kinds of people opening up notable restaurants."

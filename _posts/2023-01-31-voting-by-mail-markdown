"Hey, did you see [that article about HB 2229](https://www.gilbertsunnews.com/news/gilbert-lawmaker-seeks-to-end-voting-by-mail/article_66a83a08-9b6a-11ed-9d94-1f94fa1d057d.html)?"

"No, I don’t read the news."

"Oh, so it’s about mail-in-voting."

"I love mail in voting! Who has time, after work on a Thursday, to go stand in line for an hour at a polling center."

"Well Rep. Liz Harris, who represents west Gilbert, wants to end it."

"End what? Mail-in voting?"

"Yep."

"What?! No one under 40 is going to vote."

"I think that’s the goal."

"So what was it like to go to school here 50 years ago?"

[“The school’s original location was surrounded by cotton fields and students could watch the crop-dusting planes nearby.”](https://www.gilbertsunnews.com/community/greenfield-elementary-marks-50-years-of-excellence/article_8a6dba7a-abf1-11ed-aa36-6fc0219c14cc.html)

"Crop dusting? Where they spray insecticide on crops from above?"

"Yes."

"So let me get this straight. After a morning filling their brains with literature and arithmetic, the children would go out for recess in an invisible fog of stray pesticide aerosols?"

"Well they weren't crop dusting the children. Just the crops..."

"...that surrounded the school?"

"Yes."

"Fascinating."

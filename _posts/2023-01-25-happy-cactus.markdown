"Dad, do you think the cactus are happy?"

"Why, because it’s raining?"

"Yeah."

"Yeah, they like rain. But not too much."

"I kind of feel bad for them. They don’t get a lot of water."

"It’s ok, because they’re not very thirsty. What if I poured water in your mouth when you weren’t thirsty?"

"I guess I wouldn’t be very happy."

"Yeah. Ok, time for bed."

"Dad, why do people plant grass in Arizona that needs to be watered all the time?"

"Because a lot of people don’t use their brains."

"Is this another use-it-or-lose-it situation?

"Exactly. Most people lost theirs a long time ago."

"Dad, lobster rolls are amazing. Can we eat lobster every day?"

"No, lobster’s pretty expensive."

"Every other day?"

"Probably not."

"The day after every other day?"

"… we’ll see."

"Yessssssssssssss. Maybe next time they’ll have the shrimp toast. It looks sooooooo good."

"We’ll have to come back."

"Tomorrow?"

"Trex, stop it."

"Hey, how do you always know what’s coming in Gilbert?"

"Besides just driving by things?"

"Yeah."

"Usually [Mouth by Southwest](https://mouthbysouthwest.com/) will have things. [What Now Phoenix](https://whatnowphoenix.com/) also has things. Sometimes [Phoenix New Times](https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/) will have things, but usually a day or two after Mouth by Southwest. Also, the [Gilbert Now Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/gilbertnow) has things sometimes. Oh, and there’s [Phoenix Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/), but it requires a subscription so I mostly just read the headlines."

"That’s quite a list!"

"If you really want to nerd out, sometimes I check in on the [Town of Gilbert’s planning page](https://tog.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Shortlist/index.html?appid=d0f73c52560e40d6a753ea3913364f57). You can look at new construction in the area, and things that are still under review with the planning board. It’s pretty fun to look at, but will make you crazy when you see things rezoned from something cool to more low-density residential."

"You know I’ll never go there."

"Yep, it’s my favorite though."

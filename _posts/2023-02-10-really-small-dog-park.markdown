At a Gilbert planning commissioner meeting…

"I’m not too sure about your new mixed-use community amendment."

"What’s wrong with it, Commissioner Fay? We’ve changed the plan a dozen times for you guys."

"Well, we appreciate the underground parking, and I guess we like the mixed-use aspect, even though we hate the idea of creating walkable communities. The real problem is that your dog park is really small."

"Well, sir, there’s not a lot of green space around, so we’re just giving our dogs a modest place to run around."

"Vice Chairman Mundt, any thoughts?"

["Maybe these people have those tiny, little dogs that they carry instead of real dogs."](https://www.gilbertsunnews.com/news/higley-ray-development-gets-more-town-scrutiny/article_24ca217e-a730-11ed-8a60-0ba02be4ccdf.html)

"Good point, Vice Chairman. Is that true?"

"Uh, yes, we, uh, cater to people with fake dogs. No problem there."

"Congratulations, son. Your amendment is approved."
